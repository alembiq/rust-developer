The next step in advancing your chat application is to develop a web frontend for the server. This web interface will provide functionalities like viewing all stored messages and managing user data. This task will deepen your understanding of web frameworks in Rust and their integration with asynchronous back-end systems.
Description:

    Web Frontend Development:
        Create a web frontend for your server application. This interface should allow users to view all messages stored on the server. Consider implementing a feature to filter messages by user.

    User and Message Management:
        The web frontend should provide functionality to delete users and all associated messages. This adds an important aspect of user and data management to your application.

    Choosing a Web Framework:
        Select a web framework for your frontend. You can choose from options like Axum, Rocket, actix-web, or warp.
        Given that your chat application is asynchronous, using an async-compatible web framework (like Axum or actix-web) might simplify integration.

    Integration with the Backend:
        Ensure that the frontend seamlessly interacts with your existing asynchronous server backend. The frontend should effectively display data from and send requests to the server.

    Interface Design:
        Design the user interface to be intuitive and user-friendly. While sophisticated UI design isn't the focus, aim for a clean and navigable layout. Considering this course is not about nice web design, it can be as plain visually as you want, you don't need to be a CSS expert :)

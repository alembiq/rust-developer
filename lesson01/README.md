Description:

These instructions are essentially slightly condensed versions of the ones above, so refer to them in case you run into any issues. Keep in mind that you can also always message me on Discord, if you run into problems.

    Install Rust:
        Follow the guide provided earlier to install Rust on your system. Ensure that it's properly installed by using the rustc --version command in your terminal or command prompt.

    Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) - OPTIONAL:
        Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website. This will be your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and managing Rust code.

    Set up the rust-analyzer extension - OPTIONAL:
        Once you have VSCode installed, add the rust-analyzer extension from the Extensions view in VSCode. This will provide you with enhanced functionality and support for Rust development within the IDE.

(The previous two steps are optional because you are welcome to use any editor you want - VS Code is only my recommendation)

    Create and Run a "Hello, World!" Cargo Project:
        Utilize the knowledge gained from today's lesson to create a new Rust project using Cargo. Write the "Hello, World!" program and run it successfully within VSCode.

    Set Up a GitHub Repository:
        If you don't have a GitHub account yet, please create one.
        Once your account is set up, create a new repository to store your Rust project.
        Follow GitHub's instructions to push your local Rust "Hello, World!" project to this new repository.

    Modify and Update:
        Feel free to make any modifications to the "Hello, World!" example. This could be as simple as changing the message printed to the console or experimenting with additional Rust syntax and features.
        You don't know much Rust yet, so the degree to which you want to play around with the program is up to you.
        After making your modifications, commit the changes, and push them to your GitHub repository.

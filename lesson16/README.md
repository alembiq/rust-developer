For this week's task, we'll focus on enhancing your chat application with some essential practices in software development: adding documentation and tests. This assignment is more open-ended, allowing you to decide the extent and depth of documentation and testing based on your discretion and the application's needs.
Description:

    Doc-Comments:
        Add doc-comments to key functions and modules in your client and server code.
        Focus on providing clear, concise descriptions that explain what each function or module does.
        You don't need to document every function, but aim to cover the main ones, especially those that are complex or not immediately obvious.

    Basic Testing:
        Write a few tests for parts of your application. You can choose which aspects to test based on what you think is most crucial or interesting.
        Consider including a couple of unit tests for individual functions or components and maybe an integration test if applicable.
        Use Rust's built-in testing framework to add these tests to your project.

    Flexibility in Testing:
        There's no requirement for comprehensive test coverage for this assignment. Just a few tests to demonstrate your understanding of testing principles in Rust will suffice.
        Feel free to explore and test parts of the application you're most curious about or consider most critical.

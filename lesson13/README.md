Description:

    Integrate Anyhow and Thiserror:
        Introduce the anyhow crate to manage errors in a straightforward, flexible way. This crate is especially useful for handling errors that don't need much context or are unexpected.
        Utilize the thiserror crate to create custom, meaningful error types for your application. This is particularly beneficial for errors where you need more context and structured data.

Use these two crates at your discretion.

    Error Handling in the Server:
        Ensure that your server accurately reports errors to the client in a strongly-typed manner. Any operation that can fail should communicate its failure reason clearly and specifically.

    Client-Side Error Management:
        Modify the client to handle and display error messages received from the server appropriately. Ensure that these messages are user-friendly and informative.

    Refactoring for Error Handling:
        Review your existing codebase for both the client and server. Identify areas where error handling can be improved and implement changes using anyhow and thiserror.
        Pay special attention to operations that involve network communication, file handling, and data parsing, as these are common sources of errors.

    Documentation and Testing:
        Test various failure scenarios to ensure that errors are handled gracefully and the error messages are clear and helpful.
